# Module_4_Challenge

This site contains a simple, five question quiz designed to help coding bootcamp students test their knowledge.

When the start button is pressed, the quiz starts, and the user is given 60 seconds to complete the quiz. When a question is answered incorrectly, 5 seconds and 20 points are deducted from the timer and score, respectively.

Once the quiz ends, the user will be prompted to input their initials, and then their initials and score will be listed.

Roadmap:

In the future, I'd like to add more styling to the page to make it more visually interesting, as well as add a link to view High Scores at anytime.
