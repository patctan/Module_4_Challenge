<!-- AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers

GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
1) WHEN I click the start button
    THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
2) WHEN I answer a question
    THEN I am presented with another question
3) WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
    THEN time is subtracted from the clock
4) WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
    THEN the game is over
5) WHEN the game is over
    THEN I can save my initials and score-->
